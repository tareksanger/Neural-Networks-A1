## Part 2

### Important Files

Part_2/helpers/Model.py - This contains a custom model class that takes the number of hidden neurons.
Part_2/helpers/construct_dataset.py - How the dataset was constructed.
Part_2/training.py - Where each of the 5 models were trained.
Part_2/Saves/{number_of_hidden_neurons}/.. - The saved models, history and other results


### Training
The training was done iteratively for 5 models with differing configurations of hidden neurons - 5, 10, 15, 20 & 25. 

The code for the training can be found in 'Part_2/training.py'.
The models, model history and other results/data have been saved to Part_2/Saves/{number_of_hidden_neurons}/...'

### A

For Part A you can see the results for 2 in PartA and the final experiments in TrainingHistory.ipynb.

### B 

You'll find the results for B in both PartB where a model without noise is trained for the optimal number of neurons. As well you'll find the analysis of all training results in TrainingHistory.ipnb

### C

For PartC 1 we created 3 datasets, Noise_Level_1, Noise_Level_2, & Noise_Level_3. Each dataset is sampled at the bottom of the dataset_samples.ipynb file. 

For 2 you'll find the chart in PartC file.
